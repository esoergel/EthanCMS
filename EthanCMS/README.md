  * allow for easy integration of custom web apps to meet specific needs on a per-project basis.
  * admin interface should be inuitive and user friendly
  * admin interface should allow control over technical details including the ability to:
    * define urls
    * choose template
    * upload and/or modify templates
  * along with deployment, provide a document detailing ALL specifics necessary for a third party to take over control of site (as a legacy project) including:
    * DNS information and login
    * information on hosting provider and for login, ftp, ssh, cpanel access
    * admin site login information
